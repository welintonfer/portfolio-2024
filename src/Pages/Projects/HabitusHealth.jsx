            <p>
              <strong>Identifying Empty Spaces</strong>: In our UX exploration
              at Habitus Health, we've noticed instances of underutilised spaces
              on pages. It is imperative to strategically fill these gaps,
              aligning with the intended visual hierarchy. By ensuring that
              these spaces are proportionately filled, we maintain a balanced
              composition where the content takes precedence without the
              distraction of excessive whitespace. This approach guarantees a
              seamless and engaging user experience, where every element
              contributes harmoniously to the overall design.

              <strong>Suggestions - Bridging the Gap with Illustrations</strong>
              : In these examples, I strategically incorporated illustrations to
              bridge and fill the empty spaces. This not only ensures a
              consistent mockup but also contributes to a visually balanced
              aesthetic. The intentional use of illustrations harmonises the
              overall design, providing a cohesive and engaging user experience.

              example of this approach is the implementation of a counter.

              <strong>Suggestions</strong>: Onboarding serves as a valuable

              about the fundamental functionality of the application. Beyond its
              informative role, Onboarding also serves as an avenue to empower
              users by providing the opportunity to initiate their initial
              configurations and update user data. This strategic approach not
              only ensures a smooth introduction to the application but also
              actively involves users in shaping their individualised experience
              from the outset.

              <strong>Looking Forward</strong>
              <br /> While the current introduction of new colours and a basic
              UI Kit sets the groundwork, considering the development of a
              comprehensive Design System will be instrumental in unleashing the
              full potential of design at Habitus Health. This strategic
              investment will not only elevate the brand's visual identity but
              also fortify its position as a leader in delivering a seamless and
              delightful user experience.

              3D Simulation and Image Processing Workflow at Habitus Health
            </h2>
            <p>
              <strong>1. Creating and Exporting the Simulation in Blender</strong>: To ensure ergonomic accuracy, we developed a 3D avatar in Blender, articulating correct postures for the workplace. Using <strong>Python automation</strong>, multiple cameras were positioned in circular layers to capture various angles effortlessly.ssential step
              towards establishing a cohesive design language.

            />

            <p><strong>2. Batch Exporting the Rendered Images</strong>: The rendered images are batch-exported using custom scripts, ensuring high quality and transparency. This automation streamlines the capture process without manual effort.</p>
